# This script focuses on extracting key entities from the relevant documents.
# Entities include Climate Impact-Drivers (CIDs), air pollutants,
# and research regions (geographical entities).
# It implements methods combining LLM outputs, expert-curated keyword lists,
# and geoparsing techniques (e.g., mordecai).
# Input is the list of relevant documents from 'data/processed/'.
# Output is structured data of extracted entities, stored in 'data/processed/'.
# This is a placeholder for the code to be added post-publication.
