# This script performs the large-scale research status statistical analysis.
# It analyzes temporal dynamics, spatial differences, and research attention
# based on the extracted entities and methods.
# This includes generating data for figures related to research volume, focus shifts,
# regional distribution, and the Research Attention Degree Index (RADI).
# Input is processed data from 'data/processed/'.
# Output is datasets and summary statistics for these analyses, stored in 'data/processed/'
# or directly used by visualization scripts.
# This is a placeholder for the code to be added post-publication.
