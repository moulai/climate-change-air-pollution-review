# This script is for the quantified synthesis of mechanisms.
# It employs tailored Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology within
# a constructed mechanistic framework to analyze how CIDs influence air pollutants.
# This involves identifying and quantifying the mechanisms described in the literature.
# Input is processed data from 'data/processed/', including extracted CIDs and pollutants.
# Output is synthesized information on mechanisms, stored in 'data/processed/'.
# This is a placeholder for the code to be added post-publication.
