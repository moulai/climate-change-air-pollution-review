# This script is designated for generating Figure 4: Number of Studies and Changes in Focus Across Different Research Regions.
# It produces a composite visualization including:
# - A central map with circles indicating research volume per country.
# - Surrounding subfigures for continents, tracking study numbers and pollutant focus over time.
# Data is loaded from 'data/processed/'.
# The output figure will be saved to 'results/figures/'.
# This is a placeholder for the code to be added post-publication.
