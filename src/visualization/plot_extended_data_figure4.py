# This script is designated for generating Extended Data Figure 4: Differences in Drivers Focused for Specific Pollutants.
# It creates a bar chart demonstrating the variance in the emphasis of drivers
# for different pollutants, showing anomalies compared to average frequencies.
# Data is loaded from 'data/processed/'.
# The output figure will be saved to 'results/figures/'.
# This is a placeholder for the code to be added post-publication.
