# This script is designated for generating Figure 2: Schematic representation of the interconnections
# between climate impact-drivers, air pollutants, and geographic regions.
# It contains the Python code necessary to reproduce the figure as presented in the paper.
# This includes creating word clouds for meteorological factors and countries,
# and a flow diagram showing influences from CIDs to pollutants to regions.
# Data is loaded from 'data/processed/'.
# The output figure will be saved to 'results/figures/'.
# This is a placeholder for the code to be added post-publication.
