# This script is designated for generating Figure 5: Research Attention and Influencing Factors in Different Regions.
# It creates:
# a) A map showing country-level distribution of the most studied pollutant, by income group.
# b) A map of the Research Attention Degree Index (RADI).
# c) A correlation analysis plot between RADI and selected factors (socioeconomic, climatic, pollution).
# Data is loaded from 'data/processed/'.
# The output figure will be saved to 'results/figures/'.
# This is a placeholder for the code to be added post-publication.
