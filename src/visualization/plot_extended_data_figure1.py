# This script is designated for generating Extended Data Figure 1: Frequency of Driver Keywords.
# It creates a visualization (e.g., a treemap)
# showing the frequency of each driver keyword found in the literature corpus.
# Data is loaded from 'data/processed/'.
# The output figure will be saved to 'results/figures/'.
# This is a placeholder for the code to be added post-publication.
