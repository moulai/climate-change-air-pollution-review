# This script is responsible for the document screening phase.
# It implements the logic for using Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT 3.5,
# to sift through the retrieved literature and identify relevant documents
# focusing on "Climate Change's Impact on Air Pollution".
# It may also include steps for validation through manual annotation.
# Input is raw literature data from 'data/raw/'.
# Output is a list of relevant documents stored in 'data/processed/'.
# This is a placeholder for the code to be added post-publication.
