    "# Exploratory Notebook for Figure Generation and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook serves as a space for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and for drafting or testing components of the figure generation scripts found in `src/visualization/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "-   To interactively explore processed data from `../../data/processed/`.\n",
    "-   To experiment with different plotting libraries and techniques.\n",
    "-   To develop or refine specific visual elements before integrating them into the final Python scripts.\n",
    "-   To perform ad-hoc analyses that support the main findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "This notebook is primarily for development and exploration. Final, reproducible figure generation scripts are located in `../../src/visualization/`.\n",
    "The actual code and narrative will be populated here post-publication. For now, this serves as a placeholder."
